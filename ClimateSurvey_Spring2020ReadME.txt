
##### This is the ReadMe file for the Spring 2020 Graduate Student Climate Survey for the Psychology Department at the University of Arizona. ####

This project was conducted in order to gain an understanding of the issues in our program and potential solutions that could be implemented.
The project was completely done by graduate students as unpaid labor. The work was conducted by Da'Mere Wilson, Andrea Coppola, and Jack-Morgan Mizell.
These files were prepared by Jack-Morgan Mizell. We hope that by keeping a record of this, we can benefit other programs and reduce the amount of labor required 
to track student wellness and have graduate student voices heard and valued across departments.
