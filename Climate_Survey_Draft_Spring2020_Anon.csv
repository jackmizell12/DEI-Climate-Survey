My advisor has made it difficult to meet department milestones (through not responding in a timely manner, ignoring requests, etc).","Mentor-mentee agreements can be used in different ways: first, to clarify lab expectations, and second, to set specific goals for each semester or year. Certain labs across the country have started to use mentor-mentee lab agreements to outline the lab culture, helping incoming students feel more clear about each lab's expectations prior to accepting an offer. These agreements can also be collaboratively created for each semester, outlining the unique milestones and responsibilities of the mentor/mentee for that specific semester. Semester agreements can be reviewed and updated at the end of the term, offering mentors and mentees a time for bidirectional feedback (i.e., examining what went well, what the barriers were, and what can be improved). In general, mentor-mentee agreements aim to clarify expectations, improve productivity, promote student-centered advising, and strengthen the mentorship relationship.

Do you believe that mentor/mentees should sign mentorship agreements?",Do you have any additional thoughts/comments about your mentorship experience?,Use this space for any additional thoughts/comments you'd like to share:
