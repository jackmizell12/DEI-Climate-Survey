# Spring 2020 Graduate Student Climate Survey Project

## Project Description

This project was conducted in order to gain an understanding of the issues in our program and potential solutions that could be implemented. The project was completely done by graduate students as unpaid labor. The work was conducted by Jack-Morgan Mizell, Da'Mere Wilson, and Andrea Coppola. These files were prepared by Jack-Morgan Mizell. We hope that by keeping a replicable record of this project, we can benefit our program as well as others to reduce the amount of labor required to get a survey like this off the ground. Additionally, the analysis code for this project shows you how to clean and shape data from independent survey questions to make figures like the ones below.

We found it particularly effective to pair the quantitative data with qualitative free-responses, allowing the data to be grounded in individual experiences. Note: we removed the qualitative data from the data in this repository to keep from identifying individuals.](BarGraphs.png)
